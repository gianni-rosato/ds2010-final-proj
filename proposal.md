By analyzing data from online shopping sessions, we aim to determine what factors affect a customerâ€™s tendency to make a purchase. We hope that our findings can boost sales of products that struggle online, as well as already existing products. This analysis will be useful for online retailers, allowing them to use algorithms to better guide customers towards products they will buy.

We plan to use this data to make a logistic regression model to determine the relationship between each element and the likelihood that a shopping session will result in a purchase. Using this model, we should be able to make inferences on how retailers can tailor their sites to boost sales.

This data set is a collection of online shopping sessions with a plethora of variables attached to each session. The element we are most interested in is the revenue element which represents whether the session resulted in a purchase being made. There is also no missing data in this data set according to our source, however we will still check for that in our analysis. Below is the data set that we are using, which we sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
